- Never create mocks, tests, or stub functions unless explicitly asked.
- Never use any or unknown when working with Typescript
- Always use pnpm package manager where possible
- Try to avoid inefficient designs like polling, which wastes api requests and causes unnecessary latency
- Please stop and ask questions if needed. I prefer you to stop and ask questions over implementing something we may delete.
